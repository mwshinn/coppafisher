    Saves a .csv files containing gene spot information compatible with pciSeq. The csv contains:

    - Gene: Name of gene each spot was assigned to.
    - y: y coordinate of each spot in stitched coordinate system.
    - x: x coordinate of each spot in stitched coordinate system.
    - z_stack: z coordinate of each spot in stitched coordinate system (in units of z-pixels).
    - score: the spot's score.

    Only spots which pass the thresholds are saved.

    One .csv file is saved for each method: *omp*, *anchor*, and *prob*. The .csv file is saved into the directory
    where the notebook is located.

    Args:
        nb (Notebook): the experiment's coppafish outputted Notebook, must have completed at least up to call spots.
        method (str): gene calling method. Can be 'omp', 'anchor', or 'prob'.
        intensity_thresh (float, optional): only include spots with colour intensity >= intensity_thresh. Default: 0
        score_thresh (float, optional): only include spots with score >= score_thresh. Default: 0.

    Returns:
        (str): csv_file_path. The file path to the saved csv file.
