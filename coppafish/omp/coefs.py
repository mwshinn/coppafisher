        Compute OMP coefficients for all pixel colours. At each iteration of OMP, the next best gene assignment is found
        from the residual spot colours divided by their L2 norm + normalisation_shift. A pixel is stopped iterating on if
        gene assignment fails. See function `get_next_gene_assignments` below for details on the stopping criteria and gene
        scoring. Pixels that are gene assigned are then fitted with the additional gene to find updated coefficients. See
        function `get_next_gene_coefficients` for details on the coefficient computation. All computations are run with
        32-bit float precision.

        Args:
            - pixel_colours (`(n_pixels x n_rounds_use x n_channels_use) ndarray[float]`): pixel intensity in each
                sequencing round and channel.
            - bled_codes (`(n_genes x n_rounds_use x n_channels_use) ndarray[float32]`): every gene bled code.
            - background_codes (`(n_channels_use x n_rounds_use x n_channels_use) tensor[float]`): the background bled
                codes. These are simply uniform brightness in one channel for all rounds. background_codes[0] is the first
                code, background_codes[1] is the second code, etc.
            - colour_norm_factor (`(1 x n_rounds_use x n_channels_use) ndarray[float32]`): colour scaling applied to each
                round/channel, calculated during call spots.
            - maximum_iterations (int): the maximum number of gene assignments allowed for one pixel.
            - dot_product_threshold (float): a gene must have a dot product score above this value on the residual spot
                colour to be assigned the gene. If more than one gene is above this threshold, the top score is used.
            - normalisation_shift (float): during OMP each gene assignment iteration, the residual spot colour is
                normalised by dividing by its L2 norm + normalisation_shift. At the end of the computation, the final
                coefficients are divided by the L2 norm of the pixel colour + normalisation_shift.
