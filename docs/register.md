# Register Documentation

The Register section of the pipeline is responsible for ensuring all rounds and channels within a tile are well-aligned. This is a crucial step with our combinatorial setup, as each gene is identified with a barcode that can only be read when all rounds and channels are very well aligned. The difficulty of registration increases with the resolution of the images, which is very high as a result of the deconvolution performed in the filter section.
